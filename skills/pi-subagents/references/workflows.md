## Best Practices

### Prefer async orchestration

Launch every subagent asynchronously by default. Use `async: true` for scouts, researchers, workers, reviewers, validators, oracle checks, one-off delegates, chains, and parallel groups unless you intentionally need a foreground/blocking run. The parent should keep moving: inspect code while scouts run, prepare validation while a worker implements, do a local diff pass while reviewers review, and synthesize or verify while a fix worker applies accepted feedback. Async is the default orchestration posture; foreground runs are the explicit opt-out.

### Keep writes single-threaded by default

A strong pattern is one main decision-maker plus advisory/research/review/validation subagents around it. Use `oracle` for advice and `worker` for the actual write path. Parallelize reading, review, validation, and synthesis support, not normal writes, unless you deliberately isolate writers with worktrees. A child that writes should report what changed, what was left undone, commands run with exit codes, validation evidence, surprises, and any decisions that need parent approval.

### Use fork for branched advisory or execution threads

Forked runs are useful when the child should reason in a separate thread while
still inheriting the parent’s accumulated context. They are especially useful for
`oracle`, which audits inherited decisions and drift. For adversarial code review,
prefer fresh-context reviewers that inspect the repo and diff directly unless the
user explicitly requests forked context.

### Prefer narrow tasks

Give subagents specific tasks rather than vague mandates.
`Review auth.ts for null-check gaps` works better than `Review everything`.

### Escalate decisions upward

If a subagent encounters an unapproved product, architecture, or scope choice,
it should coordinate back via `intercom` instead of deciding alone.

### Intervene only on clear control signals

Use subagent control proactively when a delegated run emits `needs_attention`, or when a human asks you to regain control. Do not interrupt just because a child has briefly produced no output. Silence can be normal during long tool calls, test runs, or model reasoning.

### Name sessions meaningfully

Use `/name` so intercom targeting stays stable.

## Common Workflows

### Recon → Plan → Implement

```typescript
subagent({
  chain: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Map the auth flow and summarize relevant files" },
    { agent: "planner", task: "Plan the migration from {previous}" },
    { agent: "worker", task: "Implement the approved plan from {previous}" }
  ]
})
```

### Clarify → Plan → Implement → Review (self-orchestrated workflow)

When you are the orchestrating agent for a new feature or non-trivial change, factor in the packaged prompt workflows without literally invoking slash commands. Use the same patterns through tools and subagents.

Keep builtin agent defaults unless the user explicitly asks for a different model, thinking level, skills, output behavior, context mode, or other override. Do not add overrides just because you are orchestrating; the defaults encode the intended role behavior. In particular, packaged `planner`, `worker`, and `oracle` default to forked context.

When the user approves launching a subagent to carry out a plan or workflow, treat that as approval to generate a proper role-specific meta prompt for that subagent. Include the approved plan path or summary, clarified requirements, non-goals, relevant context, role boundaries, files or areas to inspect, acceptance criteria, expected output, and validation expectations. Do not pass vague instructions like “implement the plan fully” or “review this” by themselves.

- `/gather-context-and-clarify` maps to: launch `scout` and, when needed, `researcher`; synthesize findings; then use `interview` to ask every clarification question needed for shared understanding.
- `/parallel-review` maps to: launch fresh-context `reviewer` agents with distinct review angles; synthesize the feedback before applying anything.
- `/review-loop` maps to: keep the parent in charge of worker → fresh reviewers → synthesized fix worker cycles until no fixes worth doing now remain, an unapproved decision appears, or the review-round cap is reached.
- `/parallel-research` maps to: combine local `scout` context with external `researcher` evidence when current docs, ecosystem behavior, or API details matter.
- `/parallel-context-build` maps to: run a chain-mode parallel group of `context-builder` agents with distinct temp output paths, then synthesize their context and meta-prompt sections.
- `/parallel-handoff-plan` maps to: run external `researcher` plus local/strategy `context-builder` passes, then a synthesis `context-builder` that writes an implementation handoff plan and implementation-ready meta-prompt.
- `/parallel-cleanup` maps to: use review-only cleanup passes after implementation, especially for simplicity, verbosity, and redundant tests.

For feature work, use this sequence as scaffolding for parent-agent behavior:

```text
clarify → validation contract → planner → async worker → parallel async fresh-context reviewers/validators → async fix worker → follow-up review when warranted → parent review
```

The validation contract defines what done means before code is written: expected behavior, acceptance checks, commands or user flows to exercise, and evidence the worker should return. Keep it lightweight for small tasks, but make it explicit enough that reviewers and validators are checking the intended outcome rather than the worker’s own assumptions.

The first `worker` implements the approved plan. The parent continues with independent inspection or validation prep while it runs, not parallel edits to the same worktree. When the async worker completes, treat its handoff as the transition into review, not as final completion, unless the user explicitly asked for worker-only work, review-only output, or to stop after implementation. Parallel reviewers inspect the resulting diff from fresh context. Validators check behavior with the best available evidence: commands, tests, browser/CLI interaction, screenshots, logs, or manual reproduction notes. The final `worker` applies synthesized review fixes in forked context, then the parent looks over the final diff before completing. The parent may launch these steps as an initial async chain when the workflow is already clear, or as follow-up subagent runs after each async completion. Initial chains should pass `async: true` so the main chat is unblocked; avoid `clarify: true` unless the user asked for foreground clarification. Do not stop after parallel review unless the user explicitly asked for review-only output or the review surfaced a decision that needs approval first.

For complex work, risky changes, broad refactors, or many changed lines, increase review and validation fanout rather than trusting one reviewer. Use distinct angles such as correctness/regressions, tests/validation, simplicity/maintainability, security/privacy, performance, docs/API contracts, and user-flow behavior. When reviewers find non-trivial issues or the fix worker touches many lines, run another focused review round before final validation.

For very large work, split into serial milestones instead of launching a swarm of writers. Each milestone gets one writer, a validation contract, fresh-context review/validation, a fix pass, and parent acceptance before the next milestone starts. Use parallel subagents inside a milestone for read-only context, research, review, and validation only.

Keep orchestration authority in the parent session. Child subagents should not launch more subagents, read this skill, or run their own orchestration loops. Spawned subagents do not receive the `pi-subagents` skill, parent-only status/control/slash messages, prior parent `subagent` tool-call/tool-result artifacts, or the `subagent` extension tool. Child context filtering also strips old hidden orchestration-instruction messages when they appear in inherited history. Every child also receives a boundary instruction that says the parent owns orchestration, the child must not propose or run subagents, and implementation children must call real edit/write tools instead of printing pseudo tool calls. Pass children concrete role-specific work instead.

1. Clarify first. This is mandatory. Gather code context with `scout` or `context-builder`, add `researcher` only when external evidence matters, then ask the user clarifying questions with `interview` until scope, acceptance criteria, constraints, and non-goals are clear.
2. Define the validation contract. State what done means before implementation: expected behavior, checks to run, user flows to exercise, and evidence required in the worker handoff. For UI, CLI, integration, or workflow changes, include at least one validator angle that uses the product the way a user would rather than only reading code.
3. Plan when useful. For complex work, call `planner` or write a plan doc yourself and get approval before implementation. For simple work, confirm shared understanding and explicitly note why planning is skipped.
4. Implement with one writer. After approval, launch `worker` asynchronously with a proper meta prompt that includes clarified requirements, relevant context, plan path or summary, the validation contract, and output expectations. Packaged `worker` defaults to forked context; pass `context: "fresh"` only when you intentionally want a fresh child. While it runs, prepare validation or inspect adjacent code instead of editing the same worktree.
5. Require a useful worker handoff. Ask the worker to report changed files, what was implemented, what was left undone, commands run with exit codes, validation evidence, surprises or new risks, decisions made inside approved scope, and decisions needing parent approval.
6. Review after implementation. After the worker completes, launch parallel async fresh-context `reviewer` agents for correctness/regressions, tests/validation, and simplicity/maintainability. Add security, performance, docs/API, domain-specific, or user-flow validators for complex work, risky changes, broad refactors, or many changed lines. Use `output: false` unless review artifacts are explicitly needed.
7. Synthesize, then run the fix worker. Separate blockers, fixes worth doing now, optional improvements, and feedback to ignore/defer, then launch an async forked `worker` to apply fixes worth doing now when the workflow is implementation-authorized. If reviewers found scope/product/architecture choices that were not approved, ask the user first instead of applying them.
8. Review again when warranted. If the fix worker made substantial changes or addressed non-trivial findings, run another focused parallel review round before final validation.
9. Validate and complete. After the fix worker and any follow-up review return, inspect the final diff yourself, run or confirm focused validation, update docs/changelog when relevant, and summarize what changed and why.

Example implementation handoff after clarification and optional planning:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Implement the approved feature.\n\nClarified requirements:\n- ...\n\nPlan: see ~/Documents/docs/...-plan.md\n\nValidation contract:\n- ...\n\nReturn a handoff with changed files, what was implemented, what was left undone, commands run with exit codes, validation evidence, surprises/new risks, and decisions needing parent approval.",
  async: true
})
```

Example review pass after implementation:

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review the current diff for correctness and regressions. Inspect changed files directly; do not rely on the worker's reasoning.", output: false },
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review the current diff for tests and validation quality against the validation contract. Inspect changed files directly.", output: false },
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review the current diff for simplicity and maintainability. Inspect changed files directly.", output: false }
  ],
  concurrency: 3,
  context: "fresh",
  async: true
})
```

Example fix worker after parallel reviews:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Apply the synthesized reviewer feedback below. Only apply fixes worth doing now; preserve user-approved scope; ask before unapproved product or architecture changes. Run focused validation and summarize what changed.\n\nReviewer synthesis:\n...",
  async: true
})
```

### Review loop

Do not treat review as the final step for implementation work. Run reviewers and validators, synthesize their findings against user scope and the validation contract, then launch one `worker` for accepted fixes when implementation is authorized.

When an async implementation worker completes, treat the worker handoff as an intermediate state. The next parent action is review fanout, then synthesis, then a fix worker if reviewers found fixes worth doing now. This can be planned as an initial async chain when the whole workflow is known, or continued as follow-up subagent runs when the parent only launched the first worker initially. Initial chains should pass `async: true` so the main chat is unblocked; `clarify: true` is the explicit foreground opt-in.

For explicit review-loop requests, repeat worker → fresh-reviewer → synthesized-fix-worker cycles until reviewers find no blockers or fixes worth doing now, remaining feedback is optional or intentionally deferred, an unapproved product/scope/architecture decision needs the user, or the max review-round cap is reached. Default to 3 review rounds unless the user sets a different cap. For complex work, many changed lines, or any fix pass that materially changes the diff, run another focused review round before the parent’s final look; otherwise stop instead of chasing optional polish.

### Parallel non-conflicting analysis

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Audit frontend auth flow" },
    { agent: "researcher", task: "Research current retry/backoff best practices" }
  ]
})
```

### Saved chain

```text
/run-chain review-chain -- review this branch
```

Use saved `.chain.md` workflows when the user wants a repeatable multi-agent flow without rewriting the chain each time.
