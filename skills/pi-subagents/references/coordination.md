## The Oracle Workflow

The intended oracle loop is:
1. the main agent forks to `oracle`
2. `oracle` reviews direction, drift, assumptions, and risks
3. `oracle` can coordinate back through `contact_supervisor` when the bridge injects it
4. the main agent decides what direction to approve
5. only then should `worker` implement

```typescript
// Advisory review in a branched thread. Oracle defaults to forked context.
subagent({
  agent: "oracle",
  task: "Review my current direction, challenge assumptions, and propose the best next move."
})

// Implementation only after explicit approval. Worker defaults to forked context.
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Implement the approved approach: ..."
})
```

`oracle` is not a fresh-context reviewer in the Cognition article sense. It is
a forked advisory thread that inherits the parent session history and uses that
history as a baseline contract.

Use `oracle` as a smart-friend escalation when the parent needs help with trajectory rather than diff inspection: architectural boundaries, model capability routing, merge conflicts, reviewer disagreement, context drift after long work, a worker about to invent a pattern, or fixes that require product/scope tradeoffs. Ask broad questions when the right concern is unclear, and let `oracle` point out missing context or files the parent should inspect before asking again. Keep `oracle` advisory unless it has been explicitly assigned the single writer role.

## Subagent + Intercom Coordination

`pi-subagents` works without `pi-intercom`. When `pi-intercom` is installed and enabled, the intercom bridge can automatically give child agents a private coordination channel back to the parent session.

Most agents should not call generic `intercom` directly unless bridge instructions provide a target and `contact_supervisor` is unavailable. Do not invent a target. Prefer the tool from the injected bridge instructions.

Use `contact_supervisor` with `reason: "need_decision"` when:
- a subagent is blocked on a decision
- a child needs clarification instead of guessing
- an approval, product, API, or scope choice is required before continuing safely

Do not use `contact_supervisor` just to resolve review-only/no-edit versus progress-writing or artifact-writing instructions. No-edit wins, and the child should return review findings without touching files.

Use `contact_supervisor` with `reason: "progress_update"` when:
- a child is explicitly asked for progress
- a meaningful discovery changes the plan
- a long-running child needs to report a blocked/progress checkpoint without waiting for normal tool return flow

Message conventions:
- `reason: "need_decision"` waits for the parent reply and returns it to the child.
- `reason: "progress_update"` is non-blocking and should stay concise.
- Child-side routine completion handoffs are not expected. With the intercom bridge active, parent-side `pi-subagents` sends grouped completion results through `pi-intercom`: one grouped message per foreground parent run and one per completed async result file. Acknowledged foreground delivery returns a compact receipt with artifact/session paths; if unacknowledged, the normal full output is preserved. Grouped messages include child intercom targets and full child summaries.

If bridge instructions provide the child-facing tool, a child can ask:

```typescript
contact_supervisor({
  reason: "need_decision",
  message: "Should I optimize for readability or performance here?"
})
```

The parent replies with:

```typescript
intercom({ action: "reply", message: "Optimize for readability." })
```

Or inspects unresolved asks first:

```typescript
intercom({ action: "pending" })
```

If intercom messages do not show up, run `subagent({ action: "doctor" })` or `/subagents-doctor`.
