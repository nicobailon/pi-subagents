## Running Subagents

### Single agent

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "oracle",
  task: "Review my current direction and challenge assumptions."
})
```

### Forked context

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "oracle",
  task: "Review my current direction and challenge assumptions."
})
```

`context: "fork"` creates a branched child session from the current persisted
parent session. It does **not** create a fresh minimal review context or filter
history down to only the relevant parts. Use it when you want a separate review
or execution thread that can still reference the parent session history.

### Parallel execution

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Explore the auth module" },
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review the API client" }
  ]
})
```

Top-level parallel tasks can override per-task behavior:

```typescript
subagent({
  tasks: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Map auth", output: "auth-context.md", progress: true },
    { agent: "researcher", task: "Research OAuth best practices", output: "oauth-research.md" },
    { agent: "reviewer", task: "Review auth tests", model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" }
  ],
  concurrency: 3
})
```

Avoid duplicate output paths in parallel tasks. Concurrent children should not write to the same file. For large saved outputs, set `outputMode: "file-only"` together with an `output` path. The parent result then contains only a compact reference like `Output saved to: /abs/report.md (48.2 KB, 2847 lines). Read this file if needed.` instead of the full saved content. Do not use `output: false` for this; `output: false` means no file output. Failed runs and save errors still return inline details for debugging.

### Chain execution

```typescript
subagent({
  chain: [
    { agent: "scout", task: "Map the auth flow and summarize key files" },
    { agent: "planner", task: "Create an implementation plan from {previous}" },
    { agent: "worker", task: "Implement the approved plan based on {previous}" }
  ]
})
```

Chain steps can use templated variables such as `{task}`, `{previous}`, and
`{chain_dir}`. This is the main way to pass structured summaries between steps
without forcing each step to rediscover everything.

### Async/background

Prefer async mode for every subagent launch. Set `async: true` no matter the task unless there is a specific reason to opt into a foreground/blocking run. This applies to scouts, researchers, workers, reviewers, validators, oracle checks, one-off delegates, chains, and parallel groups. Keep the write path single-threaded even when the run is async.

Async does not mean parallel writes. Do not edit the same active worktree while an async worker is changing it. Parent-side overlap should be reading, validation prep, synthesis, command planning, or review of unaffected context unless the writer is isolated in a separate worktree.

Do not end your turn immediately after launching an async child if you promised to keep working. Continue the local inspection, synthesis, or validation prep, then check the async run when its result is needed. If there is no independent work left and you would only be running `sleep` or status polling commands to wait, end your turn instead. Pi will deliver the async completion when it arrives.

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Run the full test suite",
  async: true
})
```

File-only output mode also works for async single runs, top-level parallel task items, sequential chain steps, and chain parallel task items. In chains, `{previous}` receives the compact saved-file reference when the prior step used file-only mode.

For review fanout where the parent continues a local audit:

```typescript
const run = subagent({
  agent: "reviewer",
  task: "Review the current diff for correctness issues. Do not edit files.",
  async: true,
  context: "fresh"
})
// Continue local inspection, then later call status with the returned id.
```

Inspect async runs with `subagent({ action: "status", id: "..." })` or `subagent({ action: "status" })` for active runs.

Use `resume` for follow-up work after a delegated run:

```typescript
subagent({ action: "resume", id: "run-id", message: "Follow up on this point." })
subagent({ action: "resume", id: "run-id", index: 1, message: "Continue reviewer 2." })
```

Resume behavior:
- If an async child is still running and reachable, `resume` sends the follow-up to that live child over intercom.
- If an async child has completed, `resume` revives it by starting a new async child from the persisted child session file.
- Multi-child async runs require `index` unless only one running child is selectable.
- Completed foreground single, parallel, and chain runs can also be revived by `index` while their run metadata remains in extension state.
- Revive starts a new child process from the old session context; it does not restart the same OS process.
- If the chosen child has no persisted `.jsonl` session file, resume fails and reports that directly.

Use diagnostics when setup or child startup looks wrong:

```typescript
subagent({ action: "doctor" })
```

Humans can use `/subagents-doctor` for the same read-only report. It checks runtime paths, discovery counts, async support, current session context, and intercom bridge state.

### Subagent control

Subagent control is the runtime visibility and intervention layer for delegated runs. It is separate from lifecycle status. Lifecycle status says whether a child is `queued`, `running`, `paused`, `complete`, or `failed`. Activity reporting is factual: it tracks the last observed activity time and the current tool when known. It does not pretend to know that a child is truly stuck.

Default behavior is intentionally conservative. When no activity has been observed past the configured threshold, the run emits a `needs_attention` control event. Foreground runs can push this as a `subagent:control-event` event, and async runs persist it to `events.jsonl` so the parent tracker can surface it without constant manual polling. Notification-worthy control events are also inserted into the visible transcript so both the user and the parent agent can see them, with a proactive hint plus concrete `nudge`, `status`, and `interrupt` options. Visible notifications fire once per child run and attention state.

Use soft interrupt when a child is clearly blocked or drifting and the parent needs to regain control:

```typescript
subagent({ action: "interrupt" })
```

Pass `id` when targeting a specific controllable run:

```typescript
subagent({ action: "interrupt", id: "abc123" })
```

A soft interrupt cancels the current child turn and leaves the run paused. It does not mean the delegated task succeeded or failed. After an interrupt, decide the next explicit action: resume with clearer instructions, replace the task, ask the user, or stop the workflow.

Per-run control thresholds can be overridden when a task legitimately runs without observable output for longer than usual:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Run the slow migration test suite",
  control: {
    needsAttentionAfterMs: 300000,
    notifyOn: ["needs_attention"]
  }
})
```

If the run already has an active intercom bridge target, needs-attention notifications can also prepare a compact intercom ping for the orchestrator. When a child route is available, the ping tells the orchestrator which agent needs attention and includes the exact `intercom({ action: "send", to: "..." })` target for a nudge. Do not invent a target or ask the child to self-report when no bridge exists.
